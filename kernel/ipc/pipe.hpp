/**
 * @file kernel/ipc/pipe.hpp
 * @brief Byte-stream pipe with a 4 KB ring buffer for IPC
 *
 * Pipe provides a unidirectional, kernel-internal byte channel between
 * a writer and a reader.  It is the building block for anonymous pipes
 * exposed through the VFS (see PipeReadOps / PipeWriteOps).
 *
 * Blocking semantics (F8-M1): when the buffer is full (write) or empty
 * (read), the caller truly blocks on a scheduler wait queue -- it is woken
 * when the peer makes progress (reader drains / writer enqueues) or when the
 * peer end closes.  This replaces the old sti/hlt spin loop, which was a
 * #DF hazard inside the syscall path (sti-in-syscall -> LAPIC tick traps the
 * kernel stack -> sysretq corrupts).  The blocking path mirrors the proven
 * prepare_to_wait()/schedule_blocked()/unblock() pattern used by Mutex and the
 * console TTY.  In the host unit-test build there is no scheduler, so the
 * blocking path is compiled out (CINUX_HOST_TEST) and reads/writes simply
 * return what fits -- host tests are synchronous and never hit a full/empty
 * condition.  O_NONBLOCK callers pass nonblock=true and receive kWouldBlock
 * instead of blocking.
 *
 * The backing store is cinux::lib::RingBuffer (Cinux-Base); the ring buffer
 * itself is not thread-safe, so all access is guarded by lock_ (irq_guard --
 * IRQs off closes the lost-wakeup window vs the peer on another CPU).
 *
 * Namespace: cinux::ipc
