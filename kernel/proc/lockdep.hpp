/**
 * @file kernel/proc/lockdep.hpp
 * @brief Runtime lock-order deadlock detector (F4-M5 R6-Part2, opt-in CINUX_LOCKDEP)
 *
 * When CINUX_LOCKDEP is ON, Spinlock::acquire/release call into lockdep to:
 *   - track the stack of spinlocks held on THIS CPU (per-CPU -- the Part1
 *     global depth counter was SMP-unsafe: two CPUs clobbered one counter);
 *   - maintain a global lock-order graph (edge X->Y = "X held when Y acquired");
 *   - on each acquire, DFS the graph for a cycle (AB-BA) and kpanic if found.
 *
 * It also backs the Scheduler::schedule() "no spinlock held across a context
 * switch" assert via lockdep_held_depth().
 *
 * Compiled out (zero cost) when CINUX_LOCKDEP is off.
 *
 * Namespace: cinux::proc.  Lock identity is the Spinlock object address (static
 * Spinlocks have stable addresses; stack/temporary Spinlocks are not tracked
 * meaningfully, which is fine -- they are not lock-order hazards).
