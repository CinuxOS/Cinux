/**
 * @file kernel/drivers/tty/console_tty.hpp
 * @brief System console TTY: singleton owning the line discipline, blocking
 *        stdin, and job-control signal delivery (F10-M3).
 *
 * The single stdin the kernel shell reads from.  Keyboard bytes feed input()
 * (line discipline + echo + signal delivery); sys_read fd==0 drains read().
 * Owns the echo sink wiring (kprintf) + the VERASE tweak that matches the
 * keyboard driver's Backspace key, so tty.cpp itself stays Console/kprintf-free.
